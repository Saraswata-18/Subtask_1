Reason for contributing to open source :
Coding Week has been a blessing to me as it has helped me in realising that my true passion lies in coding .
Speaking about Open Source , I think it is a great way to bring coders from all over the world together and make them work under a single project.I can learn tons of things from the global Community . Whenever I will learn a new skil, I can just move to open source to test my skills. Moreover Open Source provides us with lot of opportunity like GSOC.
